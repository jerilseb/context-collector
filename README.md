Tired of messy copy-pasting from websites, especially when you only need a specific section like an article, a code block, or a list? Context Collector simplifies this process dramatically.

## What it Does

This browser extension allows you to:

1.  **Visually Select:** Activate the extension, and simply hover over the webpage. Different content blocks (like paragraphs, divs, articles) will be highlighted.
2.  **One-Click Copy:** Click on the highlighted block you want.
3.  **Get Markdown:** The content of that block is automatically converted into Markdown format and copied to your clipboard.
4.  **Paste Anywhere:** Paste the clean Markdown into your notes, documentation, CMS, or anywhere else you need it.

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Selection:** Visually highlights content blocks as you mouse over them.
*   **Instant Markdown Conversion:** Automatically translates common HTML elements (headings, lists, code, tables, etc.) into Markdown.
*   **Clipboard Ready:** Copies the result directly to your clipboard with a single click.
*   **Simple Activation:** Easy to start via the extension popup.
*   **Cancellation:** Easily cancel the selection mode by pressing the `Esc` key.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the webpage you want to copy from.
2.  Click the **Context Collector** extension icon in your browser toolbar.
3.  Click **"Start Selection"**.
4.  Hover your mouse over the page â€“ sections will get a red outline.
5.  Click the outlined section you want to copy.
6.  Done! The Markdown is now on your clipboard. (Press `Esc` anytime before clicking to cancel).

## Installation (Development/Testing)

1.  Download the project files (or clone the repository).
2.  Open your browser's extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`).
3.  Enable "Developer mode".
4.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder (the one with `manifest.json`).
5.  The extension icon will appear in your toolbar.

## Why Use It?

*   **Save Time:** Faster than manual copying, pasting, and reformatting.
*   **Clean Output:** Get structured Markdown instead of messy HTML or plain text with inconsistent styling.
*   **Focus:** Grab only the specific content block you need, ignoring surrounding clutter.
*   **Great For:** Note-taking, documentation writing, content curation, developers grabbing code snippets.

## Limitations

*   May not work perfectly on highly complex or unusual website layouts.
*   Cannot run on restricted browser pages (like settings) or the Chrome Web Store.
